## **Sample Analysis**

### Revenue Growth Calculation

```DAX
Revenue Growth =
(CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Revenue]), Date[Year] = "2023") -
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Revenue]), Date[Year] = "2022")) /
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Revenue]), Date[Year] = "2022")

Market Share =
DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Revenue]),
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Revenue]), ALL(Competitors)))
```
